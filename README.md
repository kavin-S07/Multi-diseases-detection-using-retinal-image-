# Multi-Disease Detection Using Retinal Images

This project uses a deep learning model (CNN with MobileNetV2) to classify retinal fundus images into multiple disease categories such as Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, ARMD, and Normal.

## 🧠 Project Features
- Retinal image classification using deep learning
- Model built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Achieved ~80% validation accuracy
- GUI/Web interface to upload and test images

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle, EyePACS
- Preprocessed and split into training and validation (80/20)

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV (optional)
- Flask or Streamlit (if frontend is added)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
